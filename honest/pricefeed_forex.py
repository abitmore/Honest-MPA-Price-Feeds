    Sort and aggregate data from external sources and calculate medians.

    This function retrieves foreign exchange rates from various sources,
    aggregates the prices for each currency pair, and calculates the median
    price along with the count of prices and the sources from which they were obtained.

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing the following keys:
        - "sources" (dict): A dictionary of the raw forex rates from each source.
        - "aggregate" (defaultdict): A dictionary aggregating prices for each currency pair,
          where each key is a currency pair and the value is a list of tuples containing
          the price and the source.
        - "medians" (dict): A dictionary where each key is a currency pair and the value is a tuple
          containing:
            - median price (float): The median price of the currency pair.
            - count (int): The number of prices aggregated for the currency pair.
            - sources (list): A list of sources from which the prices were obtained.

    Example:
        {
            "sources": {
                "source1": {"EUR:USD": 1.1, "GBP:USD": 1.3},
